# Preview of My Work

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on:

### [Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/samarth0822/Customer-Churn-Prediction)
In this project, I developed a predictive model to analyze customer churn. Using Python, Pandas, and SQL, I cleaned and preprocessed the dataset, handled missing values, and engineered features to improve model performance. I applied logistic regression and random forest algorithms to predict customer churn, fine-tuning hyperparameters to achieve an 85% accuracy rate. The project provided valuable insights into key factors contributing to churn.

### [NLP-Based Document Search Engine](https://github.com/samarth0822/NLP-Document-Search)
I built a powerful NLP-powered search engine to classify and retrieve academic papers. This project utilized Python and React for the front-end, and PyTorch for training word embeddings. I integrated Qdrant for vector-based storage to enhance search relevance by 20%. The search engine efficiently retrieves documents based on semantic meaning, allowing users to find papers relevant to their research topics with greater accuracy.

### [Speech Emotion Recognition](https://github.com/samarth0822/Speech-Emotion-Recognition)
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to classify emotions from speech audio files. Leveraging Python, TensorFlow, and librosa, I extracted audio features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for emotion classification. The model was trained on the RAVDESS dataset and highlights the potential of machine learning in understanding human emotions through voice.
